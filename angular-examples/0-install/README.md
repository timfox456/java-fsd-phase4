# Assisted Practice 0 : Install 



## Step 1: Set up Node.js and npm

You first need to have node.js and npm installed.

[Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Step 2: install Angular CLI


```bash
 npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Verify the version with


```bash
ng version
```


## Step 3: Run a test

Navigate to this folder (`angular-examples/0-install/`) and run the following:


```bash
ng new my-app 
```

This will ask some questions about your new app, which you can jsut accept

```bash
cd my-app
ng serve --open
```

That should open up your browser to `http://localhost:4200` and you can see the test application.
